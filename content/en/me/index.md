## Who am I?

My name is James, a student of Electrical Engineering. I like playing with some open source projects and interested in LLM and other AI related topics (no sound like a hardware guy). I love light weight and fast softwares.

I am a fan of technology, design, and innovation. Recently, I am watching Starship's Third Test Flight of SpaceX. That is so cool!

## What is this blog?

This is a personal blog where I write about my thoughts and experiences. I hope you find it interesting and useful.
